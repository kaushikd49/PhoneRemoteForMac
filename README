== Getting Started

1. Install Rails


2. Go to the directory PhoneRemoteForMac and run "bundle install" and then run "rails server"


3. Note down the URL generated by the server. It will output something like below
**** goto URL below ****
http://122.61.32.77:3000/mac/control

4. Goto the URL on any device's web browser and control your Mac.

The app invokes an applescript to control the Macbook. [Tested on OSX Yosemite 10.10]
